## The Ivory Tower Syndrome

As you might agree with me, the traditional role of an architect had a lot to do with objective analysis, clear and standard deliverables, considering long-term planning horizons, leaving to other roles within the organization (such as _product owners_, _project managers_, _system architects_, _development teams_, etc.) the responsibility to implement and oversee the delivery of the packages identified: this _[waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)_ is challenged by a continuously evolving technical and business context, that risks to reduce or erase the value of some of the analysis delivered in previous stages.

Because of this observed pattern, architects have been requested to _move further down_ in the organization chart, becoming an always available figure for shorter-term deliveries, quicker evaluations, smaller packages: descending an _ivory tower_, losing a fairly good amount of certainty, backed by best practices, standards and models, to _fight_ together with teams, reacting to quick iterations.

Such new collaboration model has brought many architects outside their comfort zone, demanding them to acquire _leadership_ skills and methods, dealing with those colleagues who were in fact far from their scope: they are now charged with the expectation to be leaders, **mentoring** and **supporting**, rather than _delegating_ or _managing_ their colleagues, especially in the implementation phase of the architecture.

Architectural models have evolved as well, introducing more and more atomization and distribution of functions ([microservices](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-microservices-architecture), [mesh](https://konghq.com/learning-center/service-mesh/what-is-service-mesh-architecture), [serverless](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)), disrupting the monolithic approach to development, leveraging the appetite of organizations to reduce risks and increase the frequency of the delivery of functions to customers: together with the software, the roles and scopes of architecture has also been distributed, and the idea of architects controlling the small moving parts of the whole architecture of an enterprise became
