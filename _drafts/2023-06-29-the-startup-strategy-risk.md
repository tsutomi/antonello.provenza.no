excerpt: Starting up an enterprise can be messy, and some small conflicts might emerge between the founders. The startup strategy and vision is one of them.

Starting up your own enterprise is a fascinating idea, especially after many years spent as employee of large corporates, with all the constraints and limitations that this entails: the idea of being your own boss, of being able to decide what to do and how to do it, is very appealing. This _happy path_ in the journey of a founders life eventually comes to a point where the startup needs to define its strategy, and this is where the first conflicts might emerge between the founders and other stakeholders (investors, advisors, etc.).

It is in fact a _luxury problem_ of little organizations having success, who require to be supported in their natural growth, since no organization is ever self-sustained: external parties will start to require a clear strategy, a clear vision, a clear direction, forcing a _joyful_ and _immature_ organization to grow up and become a _serious_ one.

## The Immaturity of Management

The immaturity of management is a well known problem in the startup world, and it is a natural consequence of the fact that the founders are usually very young, with little or no experience in managing a company, and with little or no experience in managing people. This is a problem that is usually solved by hiring experienced managers, who can help the founders in growing up and in managing the company, but this is not always the case, and sometimes the founders are left alone in this journey.

One aspect that arises in this context is the fact that the founders are usually very passionate about their idea, and they are very focused on the product, on the technology, on the solution that they are building, and they are not very interested in the business side of the company. This is a very common problem, and it is usually solved by hiring a CEO, who can take care of the business side of the company, while the founders can focus on the product and on the technology.

Another situation, totally specular to the previous one, is when the founders are very passionate about the business side of the company, and they are not very interested in the product, in the technology, in the solution that they are building. This is a very common problem, and it is usually solved by hiring a CTO, who can take care of the product and of the technology, while the founders can focus on the business side of the company.

Anyway, the pathological condition arising from both the situations is the general diversion of the company and its management from the original vision and strategy, causing a general confusion and a general lack of direction, which is a dangerous situation for a startup, since it can lead to a general lack of focus, and eventually to the failure of the company.

## Growth Pain

In the past years, I have been involved in a couple of situations displaying the patterns described above, and I have seen the consequences of the lack of a clear strategy and vision for the company, or even a diverging vision between the remainder of the management.

Both of the organizations wished to establish a more stable and planned growth, to be able to attract more investors and to establish a more solid foundation for the future of the company, but they didn't really know what does this mean, and how to achieve it: they were both in a situation of _growth pain_, where the company was growing, but the management was not able to manage this growth, and the company was in a situation of general confusion and lack of direction.

### Sudden Change in Management and Strategy

In one of my experiences, I was hired to help the company in establishing a more solid foundation for the Enterprise Architecture, its processes, functions, systems, and data, which also meant to setup a more structured and governed environment: something that clashed with the original vision of one of the founders, who had a poor understanding of the discipline, a generally negative attitude towards it, and a general lack of trust in the people involved in the initiative.

The rest of the founding members where skeptical on the practice, despite not really against it, having had experiences in large organizations, although with roles that by nature _suffered_ the development and governance processes: sitting on the side of the river, they were waiting to see some concrete results, before committing to the initiative.

In this context and culture I could observe all the negative and pathological implementation of an _Agile Manifesto_ utopia, with several teams working on concurrent matters, using different tools and processes, and with little or no coordination between them, and with a general lack of direction and focus: despite the moderate size of the IT department (less than 100 people), and with no cases of acquisitions, the proliferation of systems, libraries and solutions was impressive, and the conflicts between those teams were frequent and intense, at the point that several members, after few months, resigned from the company, all at the same time.

External factors affecting the products performances of the company led the board of directors to replace the CEO, and some other members of the management team, some of which were sponsoring the growth strategy and the consolidation of Enterprise Architecture: the new strategy was in fact to _shrink_ the organization's investments and path to maturation, removing several of the _System of Records_ and _System of Engagement_ that were in place.

Eventually the company was forced to rebrand itself, in the attempt to have a fresh start with the remainder of the employees (although none of my former colleagues is still working there).

### Knowing What you Want / Need

Another example of such unclear strategy was presented to me when I was scouted by a promising startup, recommended by a good friend who turned down the offer first, to be their new CTO, to replace the one who suddenly decided to quit the position: they were a very young company, with a management coming from mixed experiences and background, and facing the situation of investors requiring them to shape up their IT strategy, cost analysis, vision and direction.

In fact the requirements of the new position they were looking for were mixed, since a lot of focus in their prospects was given to the capabilities of _strategic vision_, _analysis_ and _IT strategy_ (with a lot of focus on knowledge of _cloud technologies_).

After a good interview with the HR (and co-founder), where we went through the reason, vision and personal experiences, I was invited to a second interview with the COO, where we went through the technical aspects of the role, and the expectations of the company: the COO was very clear on the fact that the company was looking for a _hands-on_ person, who could help them in the _transformation_ of the company, and in the _consolidation_ of the IT department, with a focus on _cloud technologies_.

As a last step of the process, I was scheduled an interview with the CEO of the startup: a surprisingly short interview (less than 30 minutes), where the person clearly stated _not being a technical expert_, and that he didn't know what the company needed in respect of the IT, but he wanted that _the mobile application to be faster_: learning of my lack of front-end skills, the interview was more of less over, and we agreed I was not the person he was looking for, although I stated my recommendation to reconsider the requirements of the role, and to focus on the _strategic vision_ and _IT strategy_ aspects, rather than on the barely research of a _front-end developer_ as a CTO.

In fact the above experience proves some of the issues in the management of a startup:

* Lack of communication between the founders on the requirements and needs of the company - while for two of them long-term vision was the focus, the third one was looking for a quick fix to an immediate issue.
* Lack of humility in the management, accepting there are areas of competence they might not be experts in - for example, in this case the likely reason for the slowness of the mobile application was issues in the back-end, rather than in the front-end: network misconfigurations in the load-balancer/gateway, database design issues, location of the infrastructure, etc.
* Poor knowledge of the real functions of roles and responsibilities in the IT department, and of the real needs of the company - the company was not really looking for a _strategist_, but in reality they were looking for a _front-end developer_ (glorifying the position as CTO) to fix an immediate issue

#### Follow-Up of a Failed Process

The week after the final interview mentioned above, it was announced the person who was hired for the role: a young _full-stack developer_ with little experience in _cloud technologies_, and with no experience in _strategic vision_ and _IT strategy_, and 5 years in the industry: a profile fitting the immediate needs of the company, but not the long-term ones.

In fact after approximately four months from that announcement I was reached again from the HR (and co-founder), who initially interviewed me, to ask me if I was still interested in the role, since the person hired for the role was not able to deliver the expected results, and they were looking for a replacement.

You can imagine my answer...

## Heroes, Rockstars and Ninjas

The mythological figures of the _heroes_ who jumpstart companies, despite the lack of security, and animated by the entrepreneurial spirit of the _Western Explorers_ is fantastic, appealing, fascinating, but it is also a dangerous myth, since it is not realistic, and it is not sustainable in the long term.

When the initial spirit of adventure is turning into the need of a consistent and sustainable growth, the company needs to change its approach, and to start to think in a more structured and planned way, and to establish a more solid foundation for the future: the fun part of _jumping without a net_ is over, and the company needs to start to think about the future, and to plan for it.

Sometimes I make the comparison between starting up an organization with starting a rock band: it is fun at the beginning, and mostly executed in the spare time, with other regular jobs sustaining the living of the members, but when the band starts to get some traction, and the members start to think about a career in music, they need to start to think about the future, and to plan for it. Only few bands ultimately succeed, cause the members, even not liking each other's, are able to put aside their differences, and to focus on the common goal: the success of the band.

Some _rockstars_ might even have success through a _destructive path_, with a sudden and unplanned success, but the majority of them will fail, and will be forgotten, and the same is true for the _heroes_ of the startup world.
