In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses are constantly challenged to keep up with evolving technologies and changing customer demands. One of the significant challenges faced by enterprises is the management and modernization of legacy .NET applications. These applications, built on older frameworks and technologies, often hinder agility, scalability, and innovation. This is where the principles of Enterprise Architecture (EA) come into play, offering a strategic approach to navigate the complexities of modernizing such applications.

The speed pace at which Microsoft is improving the .NET framework, and its release strategy of the new versions, is a constant challenge for organizations who want to keep up with the latest updates, which often introduce important performance improvements, address security concerns, and provide new features and capabilities. However, the process of upgrading a legacy application to a newer version of the framework is not always straightforward, and it can be a daunting task for organizations that lack the necessary expertise and resources.
