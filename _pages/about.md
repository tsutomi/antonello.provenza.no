Welcome to this personal blog, that is managed as an effort to share some thoughts, considerations, experiences on the topics of _IT Architecture_, _[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)_ and other technologies.
The ambition of this website is not to become any kind of authorative source of information, models, standards, but rather a place in the internet where individual experiences and point of views: contributions and criticism are very welcome.

## What About Me?

![Antonello](/assets/img/antonello.png){: width="250px" style="float:left; padding-right:10px" } My name is Antonello Provenzano and I was born in Palermo, Sicily in the 198...something (damn, I am old!).
I developed my professional career towards IT Architecture (as software architect, solution and enterprise architect), but I still keep a sincere passion for software development, that I started when I was just 10 years old (exploiting my Commodore64): while other people go running, playing sports or videogames, I enjoy reading blogs about .NET and develop software projects (open source and proprietary).

I am currently living in [Oslo](https://www.google.com/maps/@59.9077505,10.7912812,13.01z), working as _Senior Consultant_ for [KnowIt Solutions](https://knowit.no), helping organizations to overcome the challenges of architecture design and management, going full-stack from the _Enterprise_ to the _System_ level of details, until implementation and _DevSecOps_ concerns.

In my free time, I enjoy developing .NET projects and services (mostly hosted at [Azure](https://azure.com)), under the umbrella of [Deveel](https://deveel.com), the company that I co-own: most of them are (or were) open-source, but some others are closed source (although I have the tendency to eventually open them as well): apart from the joy and satisfaction I feel while creating something new, this provides me the possibility to test new technologies, patterns and methodologies.

I will try to write about my experience and challenges with them: maybe you will find it useful, or maybe you will come back with some suggestions on how to do better.
