Welcome to this personal blog, that is managed as an effort to share some thoughts, considerations, experiences on the topics of _IT Architecture_, _[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)_ and other technologies.
The ambition of this website is not to become any kind of authorative source of information, models, standards, but rather a place in the internet where individual experiences and point of views: contributions and criticism are very welcome.

## What About Me?

![Antonello](/assets/img/antonello.png){: width="250px" style="float:left; padding-right:10px" } My name is Antonello Provenzano and I was born in Palermo, Sicily in the 198...something (damn, I am old!).
I developed my professional career towards IT Architecture (as software architect, solution and enterprise architect), but I still keep a sincere passion for software development, that I started when I was just 10 years old (exploiting my Commodore64): while other people go running, playing sports or videogames, I enjoy reading blogs about .NET and develop software projects (open source and proprietary).
