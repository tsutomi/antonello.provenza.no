excerpt: "To follow the agile iterations and deliveries, ensuring visions and governance, architects cannot be distant from the delivery phases"

As you might agree with me, the traditional role of an architect had a lot to do with _objective analysis_, _clear and standard deliverables_, _considerations of long-term planning horizons_, leaving to other roles within the organization (such as _product owners_, _project managers_, _developers_, etc.) the responsibility to implement and oversee the delivery of the packages identified: this _[waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)_ is challenged by a continuously evolving technological and business context, that risks to reduce, or even erase, the value of some of the analysis delivered in previous stages.

Because of this observed pattern, commercial organizations (and some public institutions) have embraced the vision of _agile_ methodologies for organizing work and deliveries, focusing on the constant observation of users' behaviors, continuously learning and iterating products and services.

 To ensure quality, consistency and governance, architects have been requested to _move further down_ in the organization chart, becoming an always available figure for shorter-term deliveries, quicker evaluations, smaller packages: descending an _ivory tower_, losing a fairly good amount of certainty, backed by best practices, standards and models, _fighting_ together with teams and supporting quicker iterations.

Such new collaboration model has brought many architects outside their comfort zone, demanding them to acquire _leadership_ skills and methods, dealing with those colleagues who were in fact not previously included in their routines, and starting to deliver easier and more direct deliverables (_application architectures_, _ERDs_, _impact analysis_, etc.): they are now charged with the expectation to be leaders, **mentoring** and **supporting**, rather than _delegating_ or _managing_ their colleagues, especially in the implementation phase of the architecture, to be clear and simple, not cryptic and formal.

Architectural models have evolved as well, introducing more and more atomization and distribution of functions ([microservices](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-microservices-architecture), [mesh](https://konghq.com/learning-center/service-mesh/what-is-service-mesh-architecture), [serverless](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)), disrupting the monolithic approach to development, leveraging the appetite of organizations to reduce risks and increase the frequency of the delivery of functions to customers: together with the software, the roles and functions of architects has also been spread, weaking the idea of an _Architecture_ function controlling all the small moving parts of the whole enterprise.

At the same time, to match such atomization, some technical leadership roles previously in place (like _Tech Leads_, _Senior Engineers_), given their proximity to the development activities, have been _elevated_ and requested to start owning the architecture of applications, services and systems they developed, beyond their own will and initial ambitions, causing misunderstandings of the duties and deliverables.

Such movements _shouldn't_ mean that _Enterprise Architects_ would have became irrelevant, rather the contrary (at least in large organizations): in fact, they have been challenged to lose detailed view on the architecture of the enterprise, to rather focus on the leadership of people (_system architects_, _solution architects_, _tech leads_, _senior engineers_, etc.) who would ultimately provide the accurate view, governance and development of their architecture.
